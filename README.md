<h2 align="center"> Data Cleaning and Validation </h3>   
To begin the analysis I was given access to the previous 12 months of data via .csv excel files. 
These files were briefly viewed in excel to get an idea of the data we were working with. As the size of the data exceeds 6M rows, I used SQL and imported the data into Big Query. To view the Markdown file containing my cleaning process and code please follow the link directly below.

After analysis and cleaning in SQL, the data was saved as a connected sheet using google. This allows the data to easily update based on changes to the data in Big Query. 
The exported SQL data was organized via Sheets into pivot tables to further analyze and visualize the data. To view the .ppt file with data visualizations and analysis of the data, please follow the link directly below.

The visualizations for this data were made using Tableau and Google sheets.
