<h2 align="center"> Data Cleaning and Validation    
<h4 align="center"> To begin the analysis I was given access to the previous 13 months of data via .csv files. 
These files were briefly viewed in excel to get an idea of the data we were working with. As the size of the data exceeds 6M rows, I used SQL and imported the data into Big Query. To view the Markdown file containing my cleaning process and code please follow the link directly below.

<h2 align="center"> Data Analysis and Visualization
  <h4 align="center"> After analysis and cleaning in SQL, the clean and combined table was connected to google sheets. 
  This allows the data to easily update based on changes to the data in Big Query. 
The exported SQL table was organized via Sheets into pivot tables to further analyze and visualize the data.
  I used Tableau, R and Google Sheets for visualizations.
After analysis, I organized the data into a powerpoint presentation to present and display my findings to the stakeholders.
